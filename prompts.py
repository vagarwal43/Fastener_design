A safety factor of 4.0 is desired to account for dynamic loading and impact forces associated with lifting operations. \
    The class 8.8 steel bolt has a yield strength of 640 MPa. The preload is 0 N, meaning only the external force due to the weight of the motor is considered. The thread pitch for an M18 bolt is 2.5 mm, and the minor diameter is 15.3 mm. The initial major diameter for comparison is 18 mm. The joint constant is 1.0, as the entire load is carried by the bolt. Determine the required major diameter of the bolt that ensures safe lifting while maintaining the specified safety factor."
